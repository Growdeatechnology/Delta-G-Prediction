## Delta G Prediction

This Î”G prediction tool is developed at Growdea Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and is able to predict free energy of unfolding for protein molecules from its sequence with high accuracy. Free energy of unfolding represents the energy required for a protein molecule to denaturate from its native conformation to primary structure and thus helps in determination of protein thermodynamic stability. Thermodynamic stability of protein can be a crucial measure to classify a mutant sequence as pathogenic and benign.
